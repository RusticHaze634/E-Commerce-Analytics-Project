### ABSTRACT : 
**<font color='blue'> _Analyze and segment the customers of an e-commerce company by using the RFM approach.

### Market Outlook: 
<font color='green'>E-commerce stores which became success stories were successful in targeting the desired customers.  
One of the techniques by which they were able to achieve this was customer segmentation i.e. by segmenting the existing customers based on frequency of purchases, monetary value etc. </font>

<font color='green'>E-commerce stores who designed market strategies based on mass marketing soon realized the need of customer segmentation as an alternative to save cost and efforts in the digital sphere. </font>

- **Geographic -** <font color='green'>Segments based on country, state, and city.</font>

- **Demographic -** <font color='green'>Segments based on gender, age, income, education level, etc.</font>

- **Behavior -** <font color='green'>Segments based on consumer personality traits, attitudes, interests, and lifestyles.</font>

### Overview of the problem :
